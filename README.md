# Timeline

A basic Phoenix app that fetches stock data from `worldtradingdata.com` to compare
assets value over time, it returns past vs actual value of stock as well as
profit made given a money amount allocated to a specific stock.

Runs on Phoenix and Vue.js.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
